#Credit Card Validator 

#In this program, we will determine whether or not a credit card is valid with the process of Luhn's Algorhithm

       and multiplies every second digit by 2, then the program takes the sum of the numbers 
       and divides it by 10, and if the remainder is zero, then the card is invalid
